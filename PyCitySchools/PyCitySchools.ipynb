    "    _The school district as a total invested $24,649,428.00 million dollars into its schools this year. The results produced as a school district were a math passing average of 74.981% and a reading passing average of 85.805% with an overall passing average of 65.172%. The schools individually that performed best out of the 15 schools in our district were Cabrera High School, Thomas High School, Griffin High School, Wilson High School, and Pena High School. They all have a student passing rate of over at least 93% in reading and math and an overall passing rate of at least 90%. The worst performing schools in the district were Rodriguez High School, Figueroa High School, Huang High School, Hernandez High School, and Johnson High School. They all have a student passing math rate that is barely above 66%, reading passing rate at just below 81% and an overall passing rate of just barely 53%. The most amount of money that is being allocated per student is mainly on the lowest performing schools, but they are also the schools with the most students. The discrepancy between Charter and District schools is quite massive in both passing math percentage and overall passing percentage._"

    "     _Charter schools have surpassed District schools in every academic category that was measured. The size of the students could be a reason why they are not achieving better results. Schools with medium to small school sizes all produced better results; with that said, a charter large size school was able to produce the same results that small to medium schools was able to produce. This could be an issue with how the district schools are being operated or the student to staff ratio is a factor for the results, I would look into these areas to see if we could improve the district school academic performance._"
